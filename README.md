## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the faq-accordion briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with on
   the
   markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS
   classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet and some of the conventions from
   BEM were used when naming classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cube CSS methodology

### What I learned

- This was the first time I implemented a CSS-only accordion. It wasn't the easiest solution ever
  but there are many resources and examples online that can help one overcome the challenge.
- I managed to change the entire appearance of SVG icons just by manipulating their attributes through CSS.
